question: What is cash fiscalization?
answer: Cash fiscalization is a crucial process that ensures transparency and compliance with tax regulations. It involves the registration of cash transactions with the tax authorities in real-time, allowing accurate reporting and monitoring. With cash fiscalization, each sale is recorded, and a unique fiscal code is generated for the transaction. This code is then printed on the receipt, verifying that the transaction has been properly documented and reported to the tax authorities.
